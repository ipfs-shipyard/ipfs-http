# js-ipfs-http

What a future version of the IPFS HTTP API could look like, featuring [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoints.

Currently this project presents a fa√ßade over the existing HTTP API, so we can use it while working what we want out of a next gen API.
